# SoulsPlaner

This is a offline version of [SoulsPlanner](https://soulsplanner.com/) which is a website with useful toolkit for DarkSouls serials. But because of the shaky Internet connection and its large size of game data without any lazy loading, I made this for local use.

## Usage

two way to use:

1. You can visit [https://souls-planner.gutianhuang.red/](https://souls-planner.gutianhuang.red/).

2. Clone the project and open `index.html`. You could also save it as a bookmark.

## Differences

* Remove google analyze, google AD, cookies
* Change some style issue
* Change all paths to relative paths for local use
