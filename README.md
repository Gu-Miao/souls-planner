# SoulsPlaner

This is a offline version of [SoulsPlanner](https://soulsplanner.com/) which is a website with useful toolkit for DarkSouls serials. But because of the shaky Internet connection and its large size of game data without any lazy loading, I made this for local use.

**We strongly recommend that if you have a smooth network, please visit the original site.**

## Usage

two way to use:

1. You can visit [https://souls-planner.gutianhuang.red/](https://souls-planner.gutianhuang.red/).

2. Clone the project and open `index.html`. You could also save it as a bookmark.

## Differences

* Remove sign in, sign up, settings, builds, top16.
* Remove google analyze, google AD, cookies
* Fix some style issue
* Change all paths to relative paths for local use
